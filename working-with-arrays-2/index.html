  <h1> Working with Arrays II </h1>

  <h2> Codewars 7kyu, 5-6-22 </h2>

  <p>
  
  In this kata the function returns an array/list like the one passed to it but with its nth element removed (with 0 <= n <= array/list.length - 1). The function is already written for you and the basic tests pass, but random tests fail. Your task is to figure out why and fix it.

  Good luck!
